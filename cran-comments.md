## Release summary.

This is a resubmission. I quoted the language names in DESCRIPTION, as 
requested by the CRAN team. The CRAN team also requested that I add some 
executable examples. But I can't: this package does not contain any function 
to be run from the R console, it only contains some functions to be run from 
the RStudio Addins menu.

## Test environments

* ubuntu 18.04, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel & release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
